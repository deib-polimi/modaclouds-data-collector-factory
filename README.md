The MODAClouds Data Collector Factory
=============================

In the context of MODAClouds European project (www.modaclouds.eu), Politecnico was
one of the partners involved in the development of the Monitoring Platform.

The data collector factory is a java library for building new data collector.
An example of data collector built using this library is available
[here](https://github.com/deib-polimi/modaclouds-app-level-dc).

Please refer to deliverable [D6.3.2](http://www.modaclouds.eu/publications/public-deliverables/) 
to better understand the role of data collectors.
